    <h1>ChromaDB: An Open-Source Embedding Database</h1>
    <p>
      ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database designed for applications that use
      vector representations of data, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
      semantic search, recommendation systems, and intelligent agents.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is ChromaDB?</h2>
    <p>
      ChromaDB is a vector database that stores document embeddings (dense numerical
      representations of text, images, or other data). It provides APIs for inserting,
      updating, deleting, and querying embeddings with high performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of only storing raw text or rows like a traditional relational database,
      ChromaDB focuses on <strong>embeddings + metadata</strong>. This makes it
      especially useful in AI systems where similarity search is required.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Collection</strong>:
        A logical group of embeddings. For example, one collection might store
        documentation, another might store knowledge base articles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Embeddings</strong>:
        High-dimensional vectors produced by models such as SentenceTransformers or
        large language models. ChromaDB stores these vectors and allows fast similarity search.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Documents</strong>:
        The original text (or payload) associated with each embedding. This text can be
        returned in query results and sent to an LLM as context.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metadata</strong>:
        Additional structured information, such as file path, tags, language, or timestamp.
        Metadata can be used to filter or group search results.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use ChromaDB in RAG Systems?</h2>
    <p>
      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines an LLM with a retrieval component.
      ChromaDB acts as the retrieval backend by storing embeddings and returning the
      most relevant documents for a given query.
    </p>
    <p>Typical RAG flow using ChromaDB looks like this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Split documents into chunks and generate embeddings for each chunk.</li>
      <li>Store embeddings, documents, and metadata in a ChromaDB collection.</li>
      <li>Embed the user query using the same embedding model.</li>
      <li>Query ChromaDB for the top-k most similar document chunks.</li>
      <li>Send the retrieved chunks as context to an LLM to generate a grounded answer.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open-source and easy to run locally.</li>
      <li>Persistent storage using backends like DuckDB and Parquet.</li>
      <li>Simple Python client with intuitive APIs.</li>
      <li>Supports metadata-based filtering and flexible querying.</li>
      <li>Well-suited for small to medium-scale RAG and search applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Basic Usage Pattern (Conceptual)</h2>
    <p>
      In a typical Python application, the workflow with ChromaDB can be summarized as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create or connect to a persistent client.</li>
      <li>Create (or get) a collection.</li>
      <li>Add documents, embeddings, and metadata to the collection.</li>
      <li>Query the collection using a query embedding.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Although ChromaDB can automatically generate embeddings via an embedding function,
      many production systems explicitly compute embeddings using external models
      (such as SentenceTransformers) and then pass them into ChromaDB.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>ChromaDB vs Traditional Databases</h2>
    <p>
      ChromaDB is not a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and it is not
      designed for transactional workloads. Instead, it is optimized for similarity
      search over vectors, which is critical for AI applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many systems, ChromaDB coexists with a traditional database:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The relational database stores user data, logs, and structured records.
      </li>
      <li>
        ChromaDB stores embeddings and metadata used for retrieval and RAG.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Question-answering over PDFs, documentation, or lecture notes.</li>
      <li>Semantic search across knowledge bases or research papers.</li>
      <li>Recommendation systems using vector similarity.</li>
      <li>Chatbots that need to reference private or domain-specific data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      ChromaDB is a practical choice for building modern AI applications that require
      fast and flexible retrieval over high-dimensional embeddings, especially in
      Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.
