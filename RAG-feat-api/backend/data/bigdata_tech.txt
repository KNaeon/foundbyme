# Overview of Big Data Technologies

Big data refers to large-scale datasets that are too complex for traditional database systems to handle. Big data technologies emerged to process, store, and analyze extremely high-volume and high-velocity information.

Key categories of big data technologies include:

1. Distributed Storage:
   - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
   - Amazon S3
   - Google Cloud Storage

2. Distributed Processing:
   - Apache Hadoop MapReduce
   - Apache Spark: Provides fast, in-memory computation suitable for machine learning and analytics.

3. Real-Time Streaming Systems:
   - Apache Kafka
   - Apache Flink
   - Amazon Kinesis

4. NoSQL Databases:
   - MongoDB (document-based)
   - Cassandra (wide-column)
   - Redis (in-memory key-value)
   - Neo4j (graph database)

Big data technologies enable organizations to extract insights from logs, user interactions, sensor data, financial transactions, and various high-dimensional datasets. They are essential for AI, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and large-scale analytics.
